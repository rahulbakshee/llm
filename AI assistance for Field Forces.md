Hereâ€™s a detailed plan for designing, developing, and deploying your product, including examples and practical considerations:

---

### **Refined Idea**:
- **Goal**: Provide field forces with actionable insights and next-best-action suggestions to enhance HCP interactions, ensuring better engagement and prescription rates.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **HCP Profile Dashboard**: Displays demographics, preferences, disease area, and historical interactions.
  2. **Next Best Action Recommendations**: Personalized suggestions for effective engagement.
  3. **AI-Assisted Insights**: Summarized clinical trial data, drug benefits, and potential objections.

### **Steps to Design, Develop, and Deploy**

#### **1. Data Collection and Preparation**
   - **Input Data**:
     - **Demographics**: Age, location, specialty.
     - **Interaction History**: Past meeting notes, response to previous campaigns.
     - **Preferences**: Communication channels, interests in drug categories.
     - **Prescription Trends**: Current prescribing behavior.
     - **External Data**: Industry trends, drug efficacy studies.
   - **Action**:
     - Collect structured (CRM, ERP) and unstructured (email, meeting notes) data.
     - Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., remove duplicates, standardize formats).

---

#### **2. System Architecture**
   - **Frontend**:
     - Mobile application with a user-friendly interface for field forces.
   - **Backend**:
     - Cloud-hosted API for accessing real-time insights.
     - Database for storing HCP profiles and interaction history.
   - **LLM Integration**:
     - Connect to OpenAI or Google Gemini via API.
     - Use prompt engineering for generating actionable insights.

---

#### **3. AI Model Development**
   - **Prompt Design**:
     - Example Input: 
       ```
       HCP: Dr. Jane Doe
       Specialty: Cardiology
       Demographics: Based in NYC, 45 years old
       Past Interactions: Discussed Drug A; interested in clinical trials
       Preferences: Prefers email communication; concerned about side effects
       Prescription Trends: Prescribes Drug B for 60% of patients
       ```
     - Example Prompt for LLM:
       ```
       Based on the provided HCP profile and interaction history, suggest the next best action for engaging Dr. Jane Doe during the next visit.
       ```
     - Example Output:
       ```
       Recommended Action:
       - Highlight new clinical trial results showing Drug A's efficacy for cardiac patients.
       - Address concerns about side effects with updated safety data.
       - Provide a case study relevant to her NYC demographic.
       ```
   - **Testing**:
     - Run A/B tests to fine-tune prompts for accuracy and relevance.

---

#### **4. Application Design**
   - **UI Components**:
     1. **Dashboard**: Summary of HCP details and interaction history.
     2. **Actionable Insights**: Pop-up or dedicated section for next-best actions.
     3. **Feedback Loop**: Field forces can rate or provide feedback on suggestions.
   - **UX Enhancements**:
     - Push notifications for meeting reminders and insights.
     - Offline mode for accessing cached profiles.

---

#### **5. Deployment**
   - **Infrastructure**:
     - Use a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP) for scalability.
   - **Security**:
     - Ensure HIPAA compliance for handling HCP and patient-related data.
   - **Integration**:
     - Connect with existing CRM tools (Salesforce, Veeva) for seamless data flow.
   - **Launch**:
     - Pilot with a small group of field forces to gather feedback.
     - Iterate and scale.

---

#### **6. Measuring Impact**
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - **Engagement**: Increase in HCP meeting durations or frequency.
     - **Prescription Lift**: Percent increase in prescriptions for targeted drugs.
     - **User Feedback**: Average satisfaction rating of field forces using the app.
   - **Example Result**:
     - Engagement improvement: +15%.
     - Prescription lift: +10% in three months.
     - Positive feedback: 90% satisfaction score.
